### Purpose

I saw a chart of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions over time on ourworldindata.org (see chart below) and was wondering how closely that is correlated to the change in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere.  So I pulled together some data to take a look at that.  I found a fairly strong correlation (r=0.74) for data from 1960 to 2017.

### Files
* ![CO2_Data_Exploration.ipynb](CO2_Data_Exploration.ipynb) -- the notebook I created that loads and analyses CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions vs Atmospheric Concentration
* ![annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv](annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv) -- downloaded data from ourworldindata.org.
